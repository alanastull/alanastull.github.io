            I started playing softball in third grade and have played for the past 7 years. Over the course of the last seven years, I have played many positions including pitcher, third base, first base, and now center field. This past year, I played Varsity Softball for my school, and I was the starting centerfielder. I always batted in the top 3 as I had the highest batting average on the team. In addition, I was awarded 2nd Team All League because of my batting average.

            I play three instruments; the clarinet, alto saxophone, and tenor saxophone. I started playing the clarinet in 5th grade and continued all throughout middle school. Towards the end of 7th grade, I got more interested in the saxophone, and started playing the alto, then I later began to play the tenor saxophone in 8th grade. So far, my favorite instrument has definitely been the tenor saxophone because I love its deep range and sound.

            I was born in Los Angeles and lived there until I was 5, when I moved to Palo Alto. I attended Escondido Elementary School and currently attend Castilleja in Palo Alto with my older sister. I have an older sister and two younger brothers and a fun fact about us is that we all have the same initials.
